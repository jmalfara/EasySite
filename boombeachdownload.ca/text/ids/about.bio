As an avid android user and developer I feel bad for people who don't have access to Google Play's amazing online store. Many android devices (Not to mention blackberry users) actually don't come with Google Play meaning that for some people it can be hard to find a reputable source for downloading apps. I have created a series of sites intended to allow these people to access hundreds of apps without the risk of getting a computer virus or annoying popup ads. What you will not find on these sites are paid apps. I like to support our developers and I will not take money away from them. I only host free apps, along with the occasional cracked version. <br>

<br> I will always put a direct link to the official Google Play posting. <br>

<br> Thank You
